# Lending-Club-EnsembleMethod
The objective of this project is to predict the group of people who are more likely to be default and control the interest rate accordingly for the business 'Lending Club'. 
I used the pulicised data of Lending club with 21 variables and 37K observations which include useful information of debtors.
(e.g., interest rate, loan amount, delinquency... etc)

By using this data, I checked the performance of machine learning algorithms and ensemble methods in predicting the dependent variable.
The algorithms used in this project are 1. K-NN model, 2. Random Forest Model, 3. GBM, 4. Decision Tree, 5. Stacking.
